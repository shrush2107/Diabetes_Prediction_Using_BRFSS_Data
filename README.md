# Diabetes Prediction using BRFSS data and Explainable AI

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide, and understanding its prevalence, risk factors, and impact is crucial for public health initiatives. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provides a valuable dataset for analyzing health-related behaviors and conditions, including diabetes.

The BRFSS is the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world, collecting data from over 400,000 adult respondents annually across the United States. The survey includes a wide array of questions related to health behaviors, chronic diseases, access to healthcare, and demographic information.

For the year 2022, the BRFSS dataset contains information on various factors that can influence the likelihood of developing diabetes, such as:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, race, education level, and income.
- **Health Behaviors**: Smoking status, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity.
- **Chronic Conditions**: Hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases.
- **Healthcare Access**: Frequency of medical checkups, availability of healthcare, and health insurance status.
- **Mental Health Indicators**: Stress, depression, and overall mental well-being.

By leveraging this data, we can build predictive models to identify individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes. The analysis involves examining the relationships between various risk factors and the presence of diabetes, allowing for the identification of key predictors. These findings can inform public health strategies, targeting interventions to those most at risk and ultimately helping to reduce the incidence and impact of diabetes.

This study will utilize advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the BRFSS data, aiming to develop a robust predictive model for diabetes. The insights gained from this analysis can contribute to more effective public health planning and resource allocation, as well as offer a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to diabetes risk.
